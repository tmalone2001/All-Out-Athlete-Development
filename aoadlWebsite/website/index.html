                        <p>My work with each athlete begins with a thorough conversation about their medical history, injuries, sports background, and personal goals. Through a comprehensive movement assessment, I identify their current movement strategies and identify key areas for identifiable improvement that will help them reach their athletic goals. Treatment combines hands-on joint and muscle therapy with targeted exercises designed to unlock movement capabilities.</p>

                        <p>Injuries are inevitable when pushing your limits. Whether an injury occurs suddenly or develops gradually, we're here to get you back better than before. We're up-to-date on the latest research and leading concepts to facilitate improved recovery. Initial stages of treatment focuses on tissue healing: hands-on therapy, controlled exercises, and passive modalities like dry needling, MarcPro, blood flow restriction training, and compression recovery. We'll progress at a safe pace, seamlessly transitioning between rehab and training, ensuring you return to your sport healthy and confident.

                        <p>Simply being injury-free isn't an indication that an athlete is capable of peak performance. I guide healthy athletes who want to improve movement strategies for high-level training and competition. Whether it's improving change of direction, rate of force development, or overall strength, I address movement limitations to seamlessly guide athletes from skill refinement to speed and strength training. As an athlete attains better movement capabilities, I communicate with existing performance coaches or suggest new ones based on the best interest of each athlete.

                    <strong><p>Adam Gentzler</p></strong>
                    <p>I'm Adam Gentzler, a dedicated chiropractor driven by a passion to optimize athletes' movements that compliments their unique structures, sport(s), and positions. My childhood was filled with sports--mostly soccer and basketball--and sparked my love of competition.  After my years of playing team sports ended, I discovered endurance sports. I started competing in triathlons and then got hooked on running, especially ultra-distance trail running. Professionally, the entire spectrum of sports performance has captivated me. With a natural eye for movement, I've dedicated 13 years to refining my skills and techniques associated with hands-on treatments, movement analysis, injury rehabilitation, and athletic performance enhancement.  When I'm not working one-on-one with my athletes, I spend my time with my wife, Kari, and two children, Ethan and Emelia.

My son has been seeing Dr. G for a little over a year now and the outcomes have been remarkable. I will highly recommend Dr. G. He believes in more than just chiropractic work he believes in making the whole body better, I can honestly say every since we became a patient of Dr. G’s we have felt more like family than just a patient so if you were looking for someone to get you back on track and get you back to doing and living your everyday life once again, I highly recommend Dr. G

                                <p>Our daughter was a multi-sport athlete who was suffering from back issues.  Prior to seeing Dr. Adam, we had been told by several other doctors that she should stop playing sports.  Dr. Adam was so instrumental in helping her navigate through the lengthy process of getting back to competing in her sports.  With his help, she not only was able to continue to compete in her sports, but to thrive.  She wouldn’t be a college athlete without him.  Thank you Dr. Adam!

                                <p>Our son Ryan has been seen by Dr. Gentzler numerous times since his Freshman year in High School and is currently a student athlete playing baseball at Augustana University in Sioux Falls, SD.  As a pitcher/utility player Ryan has had nagging injuries that need the proper care and treatment to ensure he can perform at his peak levels. From the first time Ryan was treated, we knew that Dr. Gentzler's style, expertise, and compassion were exactly what was needed.  He takes the time to ask the right questions and is confident in determining the diagnosis and developing the right treatment plan.  It is comforting to know that as Ryan continues to play sports at a high level that he has Dr. Gentzler in his corner.

                                <p>Dr. G is the best medical provider I’ve seen. He personalized my injury rehab plan to my specific track and field event needs and was unwavering in his support. He is caring and professional and knows how to help athletes work through injuries and come back even stronger. After my ACL tear, I became a better triple jumper and long jumper, and so much of that is thanks to Dr. G.
